# k-nearest neighbors algorithm


In statistics, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric supervised learning method.
In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, 
with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors 
(k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply 
assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is 
the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.
